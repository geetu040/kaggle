Logistic Regression\n","\n","In this section we will implement basic functions that are used for training a logistic regression model\n","\n","\n","\n","## Deriving the Logistic Loss Function\n","\n","In logistic regression, we aim to model the probability of a binary outcome (y) given a set of features (x). The logistic function (g(z)) transforms the linear combination of weights (w) and features (x) into a probability between 0 and 1. \n","\n","Here's how we derive the logistic loss function:\n","\n","**1. Noting the desired outcome:**\n","\n","The desired outcome is to have the predicted probability (ŷ) closely match the actual label (y). If y is 1, we want ŷ to be close to 1. Conversely, if y is 0, we want ŷ to be close to 0.\n","\n","**2. Choosing a loss function:**\n","\n","A common choice for measuring the difference between the predicted and actual values in logistic regression is the **log loss** (also called binary cross-entropy). It penalizes the model for both underestimating and overestimating the true probability.\n","\n","**3. Formulating the loss function:**\n","\n","The log loss for a single data point is:\n","\n","```\n","L(y, ŷ) = - (y * log(ŷ) + (1 - y) * log(1 - ŷ))\n","```\n","\n","where:\n","\n","* **L(y, ŷ):** Loss for a single data point\n","* **y:** True label (0 or 1)\n","* **ŷ:** Predicted probability\n","\n","**4. Explanation:**\n","\n","* When y = 1 and ŷ is close to 1, the first term (-y * log(ŷ)) dominates, resulting in a small loss.\n","* When y = 0 and ŷ is close to 0, the second term (-(1 - y) * log(1 - ŷ)) dominates, again resulting in a small loss.\n","* Conversely, if the model underestimates or overestimates the probability, the corresponding term in the loss function becomes larger, penalizing the model.\n","\n","**5. Average loss for multiple data points:**\n","\n","To evaluate the model's performance on the entire dataset, we calculate the average loss over all data points:\n","\n","```\n","Loss = - (1/N) * sum(L(y_i, ŷ_i)) for i in N data points\n","```\n","\n","This average loss is used during the training process to optimize the model's weights (w) using gradient descent algorithms. By minimizing the average loss, the model learns to predict probabilities that better match the true labels.\n","\n","## Deriving the Update Rule for Logistic Regression\n","\n","The update rule for logistic regression uses the **gradient descent algorithm** to adjust the model's weights (w) based on the calculated loss function. Here's the derivation:\n","\n","**1. Gradient of the loss function:**\n","\n","The update rule involves taking the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight (w_j). This indicates the direction in which we should adjust the weights to minimize the loss.\n","\n","For the logistic loss function, the gradient for a single data point is:\n","\n","```\n","∇_w L(y, ŷ) = (ŷ - y) * φ_j(x)\n","```\n","\n","where:\n","\n","* **∇_w:** Gradient with respect to weight vector w\n","* **φ_j(x):** j-th feature in the feature vector ϕ(x)\n","\n","**2. Update rule using gradient descent:**\n","\n","Following the principle of gradient descent, we update each weight by subtracting the learning rate (η) multiplied by the gradient:\n","\n","```\n","w_j_new = w_j_old - η * ∇_w L(y, ŷ)\n","```\n","\n","Substituting the gradient expression:\n","\n","```\n","w_j_new = w_j_old - η * (ŷ - y) * φ_j(x)\n","```\n","\n","**3. Update for all data points:**\n","\n","To update the weights based on the entire dataset, we perform the update rule for each data point and average the updates:\n","\n","```\n","w_j_new = w_j_old - η * (1/N) * sum((ŷ_i - y_i) * φ_j(x_i)) for i in N data points\n","```\n","\n","This update rule iteratively adjusts the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual values, leading the model towards minimizing the overall loss and improving its performance in predicting probabilities for future data.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","\n","| Feature | Individual 1 | Individual 2 | Individual 3 | Individual 4 | Individual 5 | Individual 6 |\n","|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n","| Income (in Lacs) | 4.5 | 8.5 | 6 | 3 | 10 | 5.5 |\n","| Age | 34 | 42 | 29 | 24 | 50 | 36 |  \n","| Debt (in Lacs) | 10 | 15 | 20 | 5 | 30 |8 |\n","| Experience (Years) | 5 | 10 | 4 | 2 | 20 | 6 |\n","| Approval | No | Yes | No | No | Yes | No |\n","\n","## Gradient Descent\n","\n","These are the steps to gradient descent update rule for logistic regression:\n","\n","1. **Initialize weights**: Start with some initial values for the weights.\n","\n","2. **Set learning rate**: Choose a small number (e.g., 0.01) as the learning rate. This determines how much the weights are updated in each iteration.\n","\n","3. **Set number of iterations**: Decide how many times you want to update the weights (e.g., 1000 times).\n","\n","4. **Set batch size**: Define the number of data points you want to use in each batch update (e.g., 32).\n","\n","5. **For each epoch** (complete pass through the data):\n","   - For each batch of data (of size batch_size):\n","     - Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.\n","     - Update each weight by subtracting the product of the learning rate, the gradient, and the inverse of the batch size.\n","\n","6.
