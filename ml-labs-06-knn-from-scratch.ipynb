It was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). For each sample, four features are measured: the length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The dataset is often used as a benchmark for classification tasks, as it is relatively small but has well-defined class labels and features that make it suitable for valing various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify iris flowers into the correct species based on the measured features."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"537df52f","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-17T16:29:28.363512Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-17T16:29:28.363Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-17T16:29:28.367797Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-17T16:29:28.366517Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.013719,"end_time":"2024-05-17T16:29:28.369961","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-05-17T16:29:28.356242","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["data_path
